   → ✓ Constitution template analyzed (no specific rules defined)
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✓ No violations detected (constitution template only)
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✓ Research completed
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → ✓ Design artifacts created
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✓ No new violations
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✓ Task planning approach documented
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Implementing NFT metadata filtering to allow users to filter tokens by traits (rarity, color, type) in the marketplace. The solution will extract metadata during token fetching, build a trait-value index mapping to token IDs, and integrate with the existing filter UI component while persisting filter state in the URL.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/React 18
**Primary Dependencies**: React, @tanstack/react-virtual, starknet, @cartridge/ui
**Storage**: In-memory store (Zustand) for metadata index
**Testing**: Jest/React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
**Project Type**: web - React frontend application
**Performance Goals**: Handle 10k+ NFTs with smooth filtering
**Constraints**: Must not modify existing filter component or fetching logic
**Scale/Scope**: Support collections up to 100k NFTs with 20+ traits

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Since no specific constitution rules are defined (template only), using standard best practices:
- ✓ Single responsibility - Each hook/component has one purpose
- ✓ Existing patterns - Following current codebase patterns
- ✓ No unnecessary complexity - Reusing existing components
- ✓ Performance considered - Efficient indexing strategy

**Structure Decision**: Using existing React application structure in client folder

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Metadata structure in NFT tokens
   - Existing filter component API
   - URL state persistence patterns in codebase

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Analyzed existing marketplace-tokens-fetcher.ts hook
   - Studied market-filters.ts for filtering patterns
   - Examined items/index.tsx for integration points

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Decision: Zustand store for metadata state
   - Rationale: Already used in codebase for similar purposes
   - Alternatives considered: Context API (less performant), local state (not shareable)

**Output**: research.md with all clarifications resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - MetadataIndex: trait → value → token_ids mapping
   - FilterState: active filters and their values
   - TokenMetadata: standardized metadata structure

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Hook interface for metadata filtering
   - Store interface for filter state
   - Utility functions for metadata processing

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Tests for metadata extraction
   - Tests for filter application logic
   - Tests for URL state synchronization

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Single trait filtering
   - Multiple trait AND logic
   - Clear all filters
   - Empty state handling

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Update CLAUDE.md with project context

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create metadata indexing utility functions [P]
- Implement Zustand store for filter state [P]
- Create use-metadata-filters hook
- Enhance marketplace-tokens-fetcher with metadata processing
- Integrate filtering into items component
- Add URL state persistence
- Write comprehensive tests

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Utilities and store first (foundation)
- Hook implementation next (business logic)
- Component integration last (UI layer)
- Tests throughout following TDD

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
