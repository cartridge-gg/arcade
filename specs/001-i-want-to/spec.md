# Feature Specification: NFT Metadata Filtering

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to add a new feature of metadata filtering for NFT tokens. Everytime we display content in @client/src/components/items/index.tsx we are fetching NFT tokens from a specific collection using this custom hook @client/src/hooks/marketplace-tokens-fetcher.ts. While fetching the tokens, we will get metadata and precompute an array for displaying those using this schema: { [trait]: {[value]: [token_ids[]]}}. You can take inspiration from @client/src/hooks/market-filters.ts"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  NFT metadata filtering feature identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: NFT tokens, metadata filtering, trait-value pairs, token grouping
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked filtering UI/UX requirements
   ’ Marked performance requirements
   ’ Marked multiple filter behavior
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  User flow for filtering NFTs by metadata traits
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  Each requirement is testable
   ’ Ambiguous requirements marked
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  NFT Token, Metadata Traits, Filter State
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - UI/UX details needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a marketplace user browsing a NFT collection, I want to filter tokens by their metadata traits (e.g., rarity, color, type) so that I can quickly find NFTs that match my specific interests without scrolling through the entire collection.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a collection page with 1000 NFTs displayed, **When** user selects "Legendary" rarity filter, **Then** only NFTs with "Legendary" rarity trait are shown
2. **Given** multiple trait filters available, **When** user selects "Blue" background and "Gold" border, **Then** only NFTs matching both criteria are displayed
3. **Given** active filters applied, **When** user clicks a "Clear filters" option, **Then** all NFTs in the collection are displayed again
4. **Given** a filter with no matching NFTs, **When** user applies it, **Then** an empty state message appears indicating no matches found
5. **Given** NFTs are being fetched, **When** metadata is loaded, **Then** filter options dynamically populate based on actual traits in the collection

### Edge Cases

- What happens when NFT metadata is malformed or missing?
- How does system handle NFTs with no traits/attributes?
- What occurs when collection has thousands of unique trait values?
- How are filters persisted when user navigates away and returns?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract metadata traits from all NFTs in a collection during data fetching
- **FR-002**: System MUST group tokens by their trait-value combinations using the schema { [trait]: {[value]: [token_ids[]]}}
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select one or more trait filters to narrow down displayed NFTs
- **FR-004**: System MUST display count of NFTs for each filter option before applying
- **FR-005**: System MUST update displayed NFTs in real-time when filters are applied/removed
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a way to clear all active filters at once
- **FR-007**: Filter interface MUST be in a sidebar. Component is already designed in @client/src/components/filters/index.tsx. DO NOT MODIFY IT.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle collections with any size. Fetching logic is defined @client/src/hooks/marketplace-tokens-fetcher.ts and MUST not be updated
- **FR-009**: Multiple filter behavior MUST use AND logic between different traits
- **FR-010**: Filter state MUST be persisted in URL
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle NFTs with missing or null metadata gracefully

### Key Entities

- **NFT Token**: Represents individual NFT with unique ID, associated metadata containing traits and values
- **Metadata Trait**: Attribute category (e.g., "Background", "Rarity") with possible values and count of tokens
- **Filter State**: Current active filters, including selected traits and values affecting token display
